# Project Proposal

## Project Title
SmartCloset

## What and Why?
SmartCloset is a web application that takes the contents of someones closet/wardrobe, and creates outfits based off of multiple attributes. Whether it is for a night out, going to class, have a business meeting, SmartCloset curates the perfect outfit for you when you have no idea what to wear. 

## For whom?
This application is for the indecisive person who never has any idea what outfit to wear. For someone who is bad at making decisions, or not up to date on the latest fashion trends. 

## How?
The application will take user input: photos of clothing items with a brief description, similar to how someone would list a clothing article for sale on DePop or similar apps. It will also take the type of outfit they're looking to curate. The application will coordinate the attributes based off what the user wants. If they want a certain color way, it will take put forth their clothing items with that color along with clothing articles that complement that color. If they are looking for an outfit for going to class, for example, and do not have too much of a preference the application will put forth clothing articles that are considered comfortable and combine them in a way that matches and serves as stylish. It would give multiple options for the user as well. The application will also account for weather where the user is and the outfits will consider warmth as well. The application may also have features like suggestions: it can suggest the user to purchase a specific item they think would go with some of their existing items, or something that is very on trend at the moment.

## Scope
This application is viable to complete in a small group, as it takes user inputs and creates combinations based off of certain attributes, and puts forth an output. This algorithm would be based on research on fashion in order to put forth satisfactory output.
